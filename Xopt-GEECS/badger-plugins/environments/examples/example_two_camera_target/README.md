# Two Camera Example to Optimize to Two Targets

## Prerequisites

HTU Ocsillator and SDG are turned on
UC_ChicaneSlit and UC_DiagnosticsPhosphor is running

## Usage

This example varies the exposure time of two cameras and tries to optimize the meancounts as close as possible to their respective targets.  To return one observable back to Badger, the two target functions are multiplied together.
