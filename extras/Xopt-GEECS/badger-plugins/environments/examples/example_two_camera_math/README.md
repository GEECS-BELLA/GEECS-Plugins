# Two Camera Example to Maximize/Minimize A Math Function with Two Inputs

## Prerequisites

HTU Ocsillator and SDG are turned on
UC_ChicaneSlit and UC_DiagnosticsPhosphor is running

## Usage

Maximizes or minimizes the result of a math function that depends on two different observables.  According to badger, there is only one "observables" called "Target Function", but we can grab values from multiple devices and calculate Target Function from these device values.

This particular example simply sums the meancounts from two cameras and uses a Gaussian function to act as a target function.
