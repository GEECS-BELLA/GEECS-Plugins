# Welcome to the GEECS Plugin Suite Docs

This site documents all tools in the GEECS-Plugins experimental software stack. Each project in the suite plays a distinct role in device control, data acquisition, analysis, or optimization.

## Projects

### GEECS Scanner GUI

A modular interface for experiment control and scan management.

- [Data Acquisition](api/geecs_scanner/data_acquisition/overview.md)
- [Optimization Engine](api/geecs_scanner/optimization/overview.md)
- 
### [ImageAnalysis](api/image_analysis/overview.md)
A library of analyzers for processing experimental images, extracting beam parameters, and generating visual diagnostics. Includes real-time and offline tools.

### [Optimization Engine](api/optimization/overview.md)
An interface layer for defining and executing optimization scans, with support for Bayesian and heuristic methods through the Xopt backend.

### [LiveWatch](api/live_watch/overview.md)
Real-time monitoring and diagnostics for experiment feedback and image streaming, designed for integration with the scanner GUI.

### [Calibrations](api/calibrations/overview.md)
Tools for defining and applying calibration functions across experiments, including device-specific calibration workflows and utilities.
