# GEECS Scanner GUI - Installation & Setup

This guide covers the complete installation and setup process for the GEECS Scanner GUI, including both basic usage and development environment setup.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

**Python 3.10**:
The scanner requires Python 3.10 specifically. Download from: [Python 3.10.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/). Use the "Windows installer (64-bit)" link. **Important**: Check "Add Python 3.10 to PATH" during installation.

**Poetry**:
For dependency management install using the official installer: [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer). Note, there is a common issue when installing on a windows computer when using the powershell command from the official installer. You may need to change the powershell command to use 'python' rather than 'py' (as noted on the website) if there is an error in installation.

**GEECS-Plugins Repository**:
Clone or ensure access to the GEECS Plugings repository. Can run from 'network' version (i.e. 'z' or 'n' drive) for basic usage. Recommended to clone with GitHub Desktop for development

### Verify Installation

Check your Python installation:
```bash
python --version
# Should show: Python 3.10.x
```

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Basic Usage (Run Only)

For users who just need to run the GUI without code development:

1. **Open Terminal**: Navigate to the GEECS-Scanner-GUI folder
   ```bash
   cd path/to/GEECS-Plugins/GEECS-Scanner-GUI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Run the GUI**:
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

#### Alternative: Using Bash Script

You can use the included bash script for Z: drive installations:
```bash
./GEECS_Scanner.sh
```

Modify the script if your installation path differs from the default.

### Option 2: Development Environment

For code development and customization:

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/GEECS-Plugins/GEECS-Scanner-GUI
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   **If you have multiple Python versions**, specify Python 3.10 explicitly:
   ```bash
   # Find your Python 3.10 path (example path shown)
   poetry env use C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   poetry env info --path
   ```
   This shows the virtual environment location for your IDE configuration.

## First-Time Configuration

### Experiment Configuration

When you first run the GUI, it will prompt for three essential settings:

1. **GEECS User Data Path**: Local path to the user data used for configs, database access etc.
   - Example: `C:\GEECS\user data\`

2. **Experiment Name**: Must match the name shown in Master Control
   - Example: `Undulator`, `Thomson`, etc.
   - Case-sensitive!

3. **Repetition Rate**: Experiment repetition rate in Hz
   - Used for timing estimates
   - Example: `1` for 1 Hz operation

These settings are saved to: `~\.config\geecs_python_api\config.ini`

### Data Directory Setup

You must copy the experiment's user data from the server to your local path if not already done:

1. **Create Local Directory**: Make the directory specified in your config
   ```bash
   mkdir "C:\GEECS\user data"
   ```

2. **Copy Server Data**: Copy existing user data from the server
   - HTU example: Copy from `Z:\software\control-all-loasis\HTU\user data`
   - Copy to your configured local path

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If the GUI configuration dialog doesn't work, create the config file manually:

1. **Create Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.config/geecs_python_api
   ```

2. **Create Config File** (`~/.config/geecs_python_api/config.ini`):
   ```ini
   [Paths]
   geecs_data = C:\GEECS\user data\

   [Experiment]
   expt = YourExperimentName
   rep_rate_hz = 1
   ```

## Development Setup

### GUI Development

The GUI uses PyQt5. To edit GUI files:

1. **Launch Designer**:
   ```bash
   # From within the poetry environment
   pyqt5-tools designer
   ```

2. **Edit GUI Files**: Located in `geecs_scanner/app/gui/`

3. **Compile Changes**: After editing any `.ui` file:
   ```bash
   cd geecs_scanner/app/gui/
   pyuic5 -o ./YourFile_ui.py ./YourFile.ui
   ```

### Adding Dependencies

To add new Python packages:
```bash
poetry add package_name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Python Version Problems
**Error**: Poetry can't find Python 3.10
**Solution**: Explicitly specify the Python path:
```bash
poetry env use /path/to/python3.10/python.exe
```

#### First Launch Issues
**Problem**: GUI freezes or doesn't enable scanning after first configuration
**Solution**: Restart the GUI after initial configuration

#### No Save Elements Error
**Problem**: Starting scan with no save elements causes freeze
**Solution**: Always add at least one save element before starting a scan

#### Immediate Stop Issues
**Problem**: Stopping scan immediately after start causes problems
**Solution**: Wait a few seconds after starting before stopping

### Configuration Reset

To reconfigure experiment settings, use the "Reset Config" button in the GUI, or delete the config file:
```bash
rm ~/.config/geecs_python_api/config.ini
```

## Verification

### Test Installation

1. **Launch GUI**: Should open without errors
2. **Check Configuration**: Experiment settings should be loaded
3. **Test Elements**: Try creating a save element
4. **Test Scan**: Run a simple NoScan to verify functionality

### Expected File Structure

After successful setup, you should have:
```
~/.config/geecs_python_api/
├── config.ini

C:/GEECS/user data/
├── [experiment-specific directories]
```

## Next Steps

Once installation is complete:

1. **Tutorial**: Work through the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) for hands-on learning
2. **Configuration**: Set up timing and scan variables for your experiment
3. **Elements**: Create save elements for your devices
4. **Scanning**: Start with simple NoScans before attempting parameter scans
