# Data Acquisition Overview

The data acquisition package provides the core components for managing scan execution, device communication, and data logging.

## Core Components

- **[Scan Manager](scan_manager.md)** - Central orchestrator for scan execution and parameter stepping
- **[Device Manager](device_manager.md)** - Unified interface for device communication and control  
- **[Data Logger](data_logger.md)** - Data collection, storage, and real-time monitoring

These components work together to coordinate complex experimental scans with multiple devices and data streams.
