# ShowImageLive

Show the latest image of a device saved in the scan data, and update it every second.
This is useful when you want to see the latest image (or live image) taken during a scan.
HTU team use this code to look at .tif images Phasics take during a scan, like a camera GUI.

## How to run
Open the script, give appropriate scan date folder (dir_date) and device name of images you want to see (device_name) in the main function.
Run with python.
Or you can simply use a function showimg_live(dir_date, device_name).
