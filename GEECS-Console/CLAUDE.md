# GEECS-Console — Developer Context for Claude

The greenfield PySide6 operator console (decided 2026-07-10).  **The screen
map is the spec**: `Planning/cutover_strategy/00_overview.md` (settled
parameters), `Planning/cutover_strategy/01_gui_feature_inventory.md` (the
capability inventory with dispositions), and the approved screen-map
artifact (regions R1–R7).  This package is the "one working screen" half of
the commit/abort checkpoint's criterion (c).

## The screen map (regions → widgets)

One main window, menu bar (Ops / Actions / Editors / Preferences / Help),
status bar (gateway addr, configs path, version).  Object names in the `.ui`
are prefixed by region (`r3_radio_1d`, `r5_start_button`, …).

- **R1 session bar** — experiment combo, rep-rate field, trigger-profile +
  variant combos, gateway/tiled/db health chips.
- **R2 save sets** — available/selected lists, Add/Remove, union preview
  line ("union: N devices"), role-conflict/reference hint line.
- **R3 scan form** — mode radios (No-scan / 1D / Grid / Optimization /
  Background), variable picker + start/stop/step (two axis rows; row 2 is
  Grid-only), an optimizer-config combo (visible in Optimization mode only —
  see Implemented seams), shots per step, acquisition combo (free_run
  default, strict — the request declares intent), live shot count with the
  `MAXIMUM_SCAN_SIZE = 1e6` guard, description.
- **R4 presets** — combo + Apply + Save-as + Delete.  A preset IS a saved
  `ScanRequest`; **persistence live** (see Implemented seams): YAML files
  in the configs repo's per-experiment `presets/` dir.
- **R5 submit row** — Stop (danger) + Start (primary).  Start requires: not
  scanning, ≥1 selected save set, valid shot count within the guard, and in
  Optimization mode a selected optimizer config.  The GUI never pre-blocks
  an optimize submission beyond that — the engine's accept/refuse answer is
  surfaced in the status bar.
- **R6 now panel** — state pill, progress bar, "Scan NNN" with 10 s expiry
  to "(previous)" (**live**: driven by `ScanLifecycleEvent.scan_number`
  through the adapter's `scan_number_known` signal), compact log tail.
  When idle (startup / experiment change) the label shows
  "Scan NNN (previous)" from a **strictly read-only** peek at today's
  daily `scans/` folder (see Implemented seams), or "No scans today".
- **R7 device panel** — device:variable combo (editable, with
  `device:variable` dropdown completions from `GeecsDbCompletions` — see
  Implemented seams), readback label, set field + button.  **Backend
  live** (see Implemented
  seams): gateway PVs — CA monitor on the readback, put to `:SP` riding
  GEECS's native blocking set — never `geecs_python_api`'s ScanDevice.
  Scalar-only at birth (composites arrive with the pseudo-variable
  runtime, if ever).

## Architecture rules

- **Never import `geecs_python_api`** — pinned by
  `tests/test_no_geecs_python_api.py` (source grep + sys.modules check;
  the grep blesses exactly one string, the
  `~/.config/geecs_python_api/config.ini` path literal the Ops menu opens).
  DB autocompletes go through `GeecsDb` (`geecs_ca_gateway`, an allowed
  transitive of `geecs-bluesky`); errors from the bluesky/gateway tree.
- **The one submission shape is `geecs_schemas.ScanRequest`.**
  `request_builder.build_scan_request` is the only place form state becomes
  a request; keep it a pure function, keep widgets out of it.
- **The window depends on seams, not implementations**: `Submitter`
  (protocol over `BlueskyScanner`'s four ScanManager-compatible methods),
  `ConsoleConfigs`, `HealthProbe`, `ScanEventsAdapter`, `PresetStore`,
  `ConsoleSettings`.  All constructor-injectable; every test drives the
  window with fakes.
- **Offline-first**: the window must open and run with zero network and
  zero configs.  `geecs_bluesky` is imported lazily (function-level) in
  `submission.py` and `services/configs.py` — it pulls `aioca` at package
  import, so a module-level import would couple opening the window to the
  `ca` extra.  `events_adapter` dispatches on event class *names* for the
  same reason (and so hermetic fakes work).
- PySide6 only (LGPL, agent-editable `.ui` XML).  Never PyQt.
- The `.ui` is hand-authored XML loaded at runtime via `QUiLoader` — no
  generated `*_ui.py` files to keep in sync.

## Implemented seams

- **Health chips (R1)** are live via `GatewayTiledDbHealth` (real probe) or
  `StubHealth` (all-unknown offline/test default).  The real probe runs three
  guarded checks — CA read of `{experiment}:CAGateway:HEARTBEAT` (OK; WARN
  when `DEVICES_CONNECTED == 0`; DOWN on failure; UNKNOWN with no experiment),
  HTTP GET of the `[tiled] uri`, and a cheap `GeecsDb` query — each with a
  short timeout; `poll()` **never raises** and lazily imports
  `aioca`/`httpx`/`GeecsDb` inside itself so the module is import-safe offline.
  Polling is **background**: a GUI-thread `QTimer` dispatches each blocking
  `poll()` to a short-lived daemon thread (`HealthPoller`), and the result is
  marshaled back to the chips via a **queued** `report_ready(object)` signal
  (`_apply_health_report` is `@Slot(object)` and connected `QueuedConnection`
  — an undecorated bound method could otherwise wire *direct* and paint
  QLabels off the GUI thread, a hard crash).  Deliberately **no** worker
  QThread/event-loop or cross-thread QTimer — that pattern aborted under
  offscreen pytest ("QThread destroyed while running").  The experiment combo
  pushes the selection into the probe (guarded `hasattr`/`setattr`, since
  StubHealth has no `experiment`); `closeEvent` stops the timer.  Inject the
  real probe in `main.py`; keep `StubHealth` as the window's default.
- **Operator / pre-flight dialogs**: a `ScanDialogEvent` is rendered as a
  modal `QMessageBox`.  `ScanEventsAdapter.handle` (on the engine/scan thread)
  emits `dialog_requested(request)`; the queued signal delivers
  `_on_operator_dialog` on the GUI thread (where the modal must live) while the
  engine thread blocks on `request.response_event.wait()`.  Abort sets
  `request.abort[0] = True`; either choice calls `request.response_event.set()`
  to unblock the engine.  Duck-typed on the `DialogRequest` attributes — no
  `geecs_bluesky` import.
- **Device panel (R7)** is live via `GatewayDevicePanel` (real backend) or
  `StubDevicePanel` (no-op offline/test default), behind the
  `DevicePanelBackend` protocol in `services/device_panel.py`.  Readback is
  a persistent `aioca.camonitor` on the gateway readback PV; because aioca
  is asyncio-based and the monitor is long-lived, the backend owns **one
  persistent asyncio event loop in one daemon `threading.Thread`**
  (`run_forever`; camonitor open/close submitted via
  `run_coroutine_threadsafe`) — the same **no-QThread** rule as the health
  poller (a worker QThread aborted under offscreen pytest: "QThread
  destroyed while running").  Values reach the GUI through the window's
  `device_value_ready(object)` signal, connected **queued** to a
  `@Slot(object)` — never paint widgets off the GUI thread.  Selection
  commits (dropdown pick / Enter / focus leave) resubscribe; per-keystroke
  edits only regate the Set button (no CA-monitor churn while typing); a
  generation counter drops straggler callbacks from retired monitors.  Set
  goes through `GatewaySetpointPut` (the one blessed `:SP` put primitive,
  `wire_value` coercion) dispatched through a dedicated `BackgroundResult`
  set worker whose queued `result_ready` delivers `(ok, message)` back on
  the GUI thread — the worker owns the cross-thread emission, never the
  window (issue #510, resolved in 0.7.0); the button is disabled while a
  put is in flight.  PV names come only from `ca_pv`/`bare_pv`
  (never hand-built — the `ca://`-vs-bare addressing rule, issue #490).
  All real imports are lazy (module import-safe offline); `closeEvent`
  unsubscribes and disconnects, never joins.  Inject the real backend in
  `main.py`; keep `StubDevicePanel` as the window's default.
- **Presets (R4)** are live via `PresetStore` (`services/presets.py`), the
  constructor-injectable persistence seam.  A preset IS a saved
  `ScanRequest`: one YAML file per preset at
  `scanner_configs/experiments/<Experiment>/presets/<name>.yaml` (beside
  the config kinds `ConfigsRepoResolver` reads), written as
  `model_dump(mode="json")` and loaded through
  `ScanRequest.model_validate`.  Save-as goes current form →
  `build_scan_request` → store (name from a `QInputDialog`, overwrite
  allowed); Apply goes store → `form_state_from_request` — the **pure
  inverse** of `build_scan_request`, next to it in `request_builder.py`,
  widgets kept out — → `_apply_form_state`, which validates everything the
  widgets cannot express *before* touching any of them (optimize presets,
  action bindings, explicit position lists, >2 axes ⇒ status-bar error,
  form untouched; unknown save-set names are skipped with a warning).
  Listing never raises (missing configs repo ⇒ empty); save/load/delete
  raise `PresetStoreError` surfaced in the status bar.  Creating the
  `presets/` dir with `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` is deliberate —
  it is a config dir, not a `scans/ScanNNN/` folder, so the repo's
  scan-folder invariant does not apply.  The combo repopulates on
  experiment change and after save/delete.
- **Last-experiment memory**: `ConsoleSettings` (`services/settings.py`) is
  a tiny QSettings-backed helper (`GEECS`/`GEECS-Console`, **INI format**
  so `QSettings.setPath` redirection works in tests) — deliberately not a
  framework; future GUI state becomes more properties on it.  The window
  writes `last_experiment` on every experiment change and restores it at
  startup only when no experiment was passed explicitly and the name is
  still in the combo (restoring fires the normal experiment-changed path,
  so configs, presets, health probe, and device panel all follow).
  Constructor-injectable; `tests/conftest.py` isolates the user scope to a
  per-test tmp path so no test touches real settings.  Also carries the
  Preferences beep options (`per_shot_beep`, `randomized_beeps`).
- **Scan number (R6)**: the engine's `ScanLifecycleEvent.scan_number`
  (`None` until the scan folder is claimed, then present on every lifecycle
  emission) is read duck-typed by `ScanEventsAdapter` and emitted as
  `scan_number_known(int)`; the window connects it to `set_scan_number`
  (10 s expiry to "(previous)").
- **Ops menu**: four items, handlers in `main_window.py`, path resolution
  factored into `services/ops_paths.py` as small pure `-> Path | None`
  functions (unit-tested against tmp trees, no Finder).  *Open experiment
  config folder* (configs-repo dir for the current experiment); *Open user
  config* — the shared `config.ini` **by path literal only** (the
  no-geecs-python-api pin blesses exactly that one string; opens the folder
  with a note when the file is absent); *Open today's scan folder* —
  **strictly read-only**: builds the daily `scans/` path via
  `geecs_data_utils.ScanPaths.get_daily_scan_folder` (lazy import, pure
  path construction) and NEVER creates directories — a missing folder
  reports "no scans today" (repo scan-folder invariant, pinned by
  tree-unchanged tests in `tests/test_ops_paths.py`); *GEECS-Plugins on
  GitHub*.  All open via `QDesktopServices.openUrl`.  Menus created in
  `_build_menus` must be referenced on the window (`self._menus`) —
  PySide6 garbage-collects the `addMenu` wrapper and tears down the C++
  menu with it.
- **Per-shot beeps (Preferences)**: two checkable actions persisted via
  `ConsoleSettings`, both default off.  "Per-shot beep" sounds
  `QApplication.beep()` (no sound assets, no multimedia dep) on every
  `shots_completed` increment in the progress stream; "Randomized beeps"
  thins that to a random ~1-in-4 subset.  The RNG is a constructor
  parameter (`rng: random.Random`) so tests inject a seeded instance.
- **File logging**: `main.py` has a `--log-level` flag (default INFO) and a
  `RotatingFileHandler` at `~/.config/geecs_console/logs/console.log`
  (2 MB × 3 backups) beside the stderr handler.  Creating that log dir with
  `parents=True` is deliberate — a user config dir, not a scan folder.
  `configure_logging` caps the `httpx` logger at WARNING — the Tiled
  health probe otherwise logs one INFO line per 5 s poll, forever.
- **The four config editors (Editors menu)** — all implemented (built on
  their own branches, #504–#507; wired in 0.6.0):
  `editors/save_set_editor.py::open_save_set_editor`,
  `editors/scan_variable_editor.py::open_scan_variable_editor`,
  `editors/shot_control_editor.py::open_shot_control_editor` (trigger
  profiles), `editors/action_library_editor.py::open_action_library_editor`.
  Each entry point takes `(parent, experiment, configs_base=None,
  completions=None)`, shows a **non-modal** dialog (`show()`, not
  `exec()`), and returns it.  The menu handlers call
  `open_*_editor(self, experiment=<current combo text>)` and append the
  returned dialog to `self._open_editors` (pruned when closed) — see the
  PySide6 ownership hazards below.  Actions are disabled while no
  experiment is selected.  Tests monkeypatch the `open_*` names on
  `app.main_window`.
- **R7 device:variable completions**: the device combo's dropdown lists
  sorted `device:variable` strings from a `CompletionsProvider`
  (`GeecsDbCompletions` in production, constructor-injectable
  `completions_factory` in tests), fetched at startup and on experiment
  change via a `BackgroundResult` worker (below).  The combo stays
  editable; typed text survives repopulation; results tagged with a
  no-longer-selected experiment are dropped.  An unparsable committed
  selection shows "Device format: DeviceName:Variable Name" in the status
  bar (both on commit and on a Set attempt) instead of a silent no-op.
- **R6 idle scan number**: at startup and on experiment change a
  `BackgroundResult` worker runs the injectable `scan_number_lookup`
  (default: `ops_paths.todays_scan_folder` +
  `ops_paths.highest_scan_number`) and the label shows
  "Scan NNN (previous)" or "No scans today".  **Strictly read-only** —
  resolution + `is_dir()`/`iterdir()` only, never creating anything on the
  scans path (repo scan-folder invariant; pinned by tree-untouched tests
  in `tests/test_ops_paths.py` and
  `tests/test_main_window_editors_integration.py`).  A live scan number
  (10 s expiry timer running) is never clobbered.  `tests/conftest.py`
  patches the module-level default lookup (and the completions factory) so
  hermetic tests never touch the real data root or DB.
- **`BackgroundResult`** (`services/background.py`, extracted from
  `app/main_window.py` in 0.10.0 — the shared home recorded on issue
  #510): the one blessed daemon-thread → queued-signal worker for one-shot
  background calls (the `HealthPoller` shape, generalized).  **The daemon
  thread must emit on the worker QObject, never on the window**: emitting
  a window-owned signal from a daemon thread races window teardown and
  segfaults under offscreen pytest (observed directly when the idle scan
  probe emitted a `MainWindow` signal; the R7 device-set completion was
  the last such emission and moved to a `BackgroundResult` worker in
  0.7.0 — issue #510).  `closeEvent` disconnects each worker's
  `result_ready`.
- **Actions menu (G-actions v1)**: lists the current experiment's
  action-plan names — fetched from `ActionLibraryStore.list_names()` (the
  same `action_library/actions.yaml` the Action Library editor edits;
  constructor-injectable `action_store` seam) on a `BackgroundResult`
  worker, refreshed on experiment change, stale results dropped by
  experiment tag; empty/offline renders one disabled "(no actions)"
  entry.  On top sits **"Enable action execution"** — the accidental-click
  guard: checkable, **default OFF at every launch and deliberately NOT
  persisted** (a fresh session must never start armed; do not "fix" this
  by adding it to `ConsoleSettings`).  Clicking a plan opens the
  non-modal `ActionRunDialog` (`app/action_dialog.py`, kept in
  `self._open_action_dialogs` — the GC hazard): a dry-run steps table
  from the engine's `describe_action(name) -> list[dict]` (keys `kind` /
  `device` / `variable` / `value` / `wait_s` / `from_plan`, execution
  order) plus Run/Close.  Run is enabled only while armed and dispatches
  the blocking `run_action(name)` on a dialog-owned worker — in flight
  the button disables and the status bar shows "running action
  '<name>'…"; success reports "action '<name>' done"; failures/refusals
  (the engine raises exactly `RuntimeError("scan in progress — action
  not started")` during a scan) land in the status bar AND inline.  The
  preview and run outcomes render on **separate labels** — a slow
  describe arriving late must never clobber a refusal (pinned by test).
  Both engine methods are `Submitter` protocol members
  (`submission.py`), mapped to `BlueskyScanner`'s same-named methods.
  A pause-the-scan flow for actions (#552) is future work.  Pinned by
  `tests/test_actions_menu.py`.
- **Optimization (R3) — end to end**: the Optimization radio shows a
  config combo listing the YAML stems of the experiment's
  `optimizer_configs/` folder (legacy scanner-GUI folder name; part of
  `ConfigListing`).  `ConsoleConfigs.optimization_spec` loads a named
  config as a validated `OptimizationSpec` — new-schema documents
  directly, the legacy `vocs` dialect through
  `geecs_schemas.convert.convert_optimizer_config`.  `form_state()`
  resolves the selected name into the spec (`ConsoleFormState.optimization`)
  so `build_scan_request` stays pure; optimize requests round-trip through
  `form_state_from_request`, and applying an optimize preset matches its
  inline spec against the listed configs by content (no match ⇒ status-bar
  error, form untouched).  **The engine-side loader is wired** (0.9.0):
  `make_bluesky_submitter` injects `optimization_loader` from
  `services/optimization.py` — `optimizer_config_from_spec` maps the spec
  onto the `BaseOptimizerConfig` dict shape (pinned as the exact inverse
  of `convert_optimizer_config`), `load_console_optimization` builds
  `BaseOptimizer.from_config(...)` + `SessionOptimizationBridge`, and the
  engine (GeecsBluesky ≥ 0.31.0) runs the optimization as a delegated
  ScanRequest.  The stack is the **`optimization` extra**
  (`geecs-scanner-gui`, the only place the legacy package appears —
  import confined to `services/optimization.py`, lazy, gated by a light
  `find_spec` probe); without it the loader is `None` and the engine's
  needs-a-loader refusal shows in the status bar, all other modes
  unaffected.  The save sets must name the objective's diagnostics —
  optimizer `device_requirements` auto-provisioning is deliberately not
  wired on the delegated path (engine decision, PR #520).
- **Tooltips (issue #497 phase 1)**: editor form fields get their tooltips
  from the geecs-schemas `Field(description=...)` texts via
  `services/schema_tooltips.py::apply_schema_tooltips` — single source of
  truth; a mapping to a missing or description-less field raises at editor
  construction.  When a tooltip reads poorly, fix the schema description,
  never hardcode GUI text.  Main-window operator controls carry
  hand-written operator-language tooltips (`_apply_operator_tooltips`) —
  those are GUI concepts with no schema counterpart.  **Preferences →
  Show tooltips** (persisted, default on) gates them all via
  `ToolTipSuppressor`, an application-level event filter that swallows
  `QEvent.ToolTip`; it is installed on the `QApplication` **only while
  tooltips are off** — an always-installed per-window app filter
  measurably slowed the offscreen suite (every event crossing into a
  Python `eventFilter`), so presence = suppression.  It is parented to
  the window (Qt auto-removes a destroyed filter) and `closeEvent`
  removes it explicitly.  Pinned by `tests/test_tooltips.py`.

## Standing PySide6 ownership hazards (GC eats live C++ objects)

Python wrappers PySide6 does not parent-track are garbage-collected, and
shiboken tears down the underlying C++ object with them.  Two recurrences
of the same bug class are load-bearing here; hold a Python reference on
the window for anything in these families:

- **Menus**: the `QMenu` returned by `menuBar().addMenu(...)` must be kept
  (`self._menus`) or the menu and all its actions vanish.
- **Non-modal dialogs**: a dialog shown with `show()` (all four editors)
  must be kept (`self._open_editors`) or it closes/dies at the next GC.
- **QCompleter** (inside the editors): a completer set on a line edit via
  `setCompleter` is not owned by the widget — the editors keep their
  completers (and their model) on `self`.  The same applies to any
  `QValidator`, proxy model, or event filter created without a parent.

## The Scan Browser (`geecs_console/browser/`, regions B1–B6)

A second window in this package: the quick-look Tiled client (day → scan →
plot/table/drift), per its own approved screen map (regions `B1`–`B6`;
object names `b1_`…`b6_`).  Own entry points — `geecs-scan-browser`
(console script) and `python -m geecs_console.browser` — deliberately NOT
wired into the operator console's Ops menu yet (deferred; the browser must
stay usable by analysts who never run the console).

Structure:

- `browser_window.py` — `ScanBrowserWindow`, layout built in code (no
  `.ui`: the pyqtgraph central widget doesn't suit `QUiLoader` promotion).
  Dark screen-map palette QSS applied at window level, over the console
  family stylesheet the entry point sets application-wide.
- `__main__.py` — `main()`; injects the real catalog
  (`TiledScanCatalog.from_config()`).  Loads `app/style.qss` with its own
  tiny loader (same behavior as `load_stylesheet`) because of the
  main-window import ban below.
- `_background.py` — `BrowserWorker`, the thin private daemon-thread →
  queued-signal worker shim (see below).

Rules (inherit all Architecture rules above, plus):

- **The ScanCatalog seam**: the window depends on
  `geecs_data_utils.tiled_catalog.ScanCatalog`
  (`probe`/`list_runs`/`load_run`) — never on `tiled` directly.  Offline
  default is `StubCatalog`; every catalog call runs on a daemon thread
  through `BrowserWorker` with generation counters dropping superseded
  results — the GUI thread never blocks on Tiled (VPN latency is real).
  `closeEvent` disconnects the workers so a straggling slow read lands
  nowhere.
- **Schema knowledge lives in `geecs_data_utils.tiled_schema`** (one
  version-tagged module; `GeecsBluesky/EVENT_SCHEMA.md` is the contract)
  and **drift analysis in `geecs_data_utils.tiled_drift`** — the browser
  interprets no column names on its own.  The pure layer's tests live in
  GEECS-Data-Utils; this package tests window behavior against
  `tests/fake_catalog.py`.
- **No imports from `app/main_window.py`** — the browser duplicates
  nothing from it except the two deliberate twins noted below.
- **`pyqtgraph` is imported lazily** with
  `os.environ.setdefault("PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB", "PySide6")` set first (the
  `_pg()` helper) so it can never bind a stray PyQt install.
- **Open scan folder is strictly read-only** (`resolve_scan_folder`):
  run-metadata `scan_folder` first, else `ops_paths.todays_scan_folder`
  for the *selected* date + `ScanNNN`; only an existing dir is returned,
  nothing on the scans path is ever created (repo scan-folder invariant,
  pinned by tree-untouched tests in `tests/test_browser_scan_folder.py`).

Kit boundary — shared-intent console modules the browser imports (the
shared-package candidates for a future extraction; extend these rather
than copying):

- `services/settings.py` (`ConsoleSettings` — the shared last-experiment
  memory)
- `services/ops_paths.py` (read-only daily-folder resolution)
- `app/style.qss` (read-only; loaded by the browser's own loader)
- `geecs_data_utils.tiled_catalog` / `tiled_schema` / `tiled_drift` (the
  data layer, already extracted downward)

Deliberate temporary twins of `app/main_window.py` internals (kept because
the browser must not import that file — another stream owns it):

- `browser/_background.py::BrowserWorker` ↔ `BackgroundResult`.  The
  shared `services/background.py` **exists now** (extracted in 0.10.0 for
  the Actions menu, per the plan recorded on issue #510); the swap onto it
  is mechanical (one class, one signal, one method) and simply hasn't been
  done — take it when next touching the browser.
- `__main__._load_console_stylesheet` ↔ `load_stylesheet`.

## Stubbed seams (intentional, wire later)

- An `OptimizationSpec` *editor* (authoring configs in the GUI) remains
  out of scope — configs are YAML files in `optimizer_configs/`.  The
  optimization stack behind the loader (`geecs_scanner.optimization`) is
  legacy machinery kept for parity; a redesigned hook (bluesky-adaptive
  direction) is planned, at which point `services/optimization.py` and
  the `optimization` extra are deleted together.
- `ConsoleConfigs._scan_variable_names` reaches into the resolver's private
  `_scan_variables_catalog()` — promote a public "list variable names"
  method on `ConfigsRepoResolver` when next touching geecs-bluesky.
- **Remaining M5 item — config bootstrap/repair dialog**: deliberately
  deferred.  When the configs repo (or an experiment's folder inside it)
  is missing/broken, the console currently reports and degrades to empty
  listings; a guided create/repair dialog is the outstanding piece of M5.

## Testing

`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen poetry run pytest -q` — hermetic, pytest-qt,
`qt_api = "pyside6"` pinned in pyproject.  The request-builder tests are the
important ones: they validate the exact `ScanRequest` shapes against the
real schema.  CI also runs this suite on `windows-latest` (the
`console-windows` job in `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`) — the console
deploys to Windows control-room machines, so keep the suite green there too.
