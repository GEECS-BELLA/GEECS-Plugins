## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- **The package** — the GEECS scan MCP server, homed in GEECS-Plugins by
  owner decision (2026-08-22; the design is the scan-MCP planning
  document, verb surface §1, architecture §3).  FastMCP stdio server
  (`python -m geecs_scan_mcp`), the osprey house pattern: module-level
  `mcp`, self-registering tool modules, a `tool_names` constants leaf
  module for profile permission lists, structured JSON envelopes
  (`{ok, ...}` / `{ok: false, error_kind, message}`) — tools never raise
  to the agent, and engine message text is preserved verbatim.
- **v0 read-only tools** (zero write risk):
  - `scan_status` — manager snapshot + pending queue items (never fails;
    disconnected reads as `connected: false` + detail).
  - `scan_history(limit)` — recent items with exit status and the
    operator-facing error line, field-tolerant against the manager's
    history shape.
  - `get_scan_result(scan_number|uid, day?)` — Tiled lookup: run
    metadata incl. the `submission` provenance record, column names, and
    capped per-column mean/std — never the full event table.
  - `list_scan_configs(kind)` — save_sets / trigger_profiles / presets /
    optimizer_configs / scan_variables (with bounds/kind) / actions,
    via the resolver's listing surface (GeecsBluesky 0.60.0, #666).
  - `validate_scan_request(request)` — schema + engine validation + the
    full client-side preflight, nothing submitted.
- Runtime singletons resolve from the standard
  `~/.config/geecs_python_api/config.ini`; every unconfigured piece
  degrades honestly (stub queue client, unconfigured catalog, no
  experiment → `invalid_request` envelopes).
