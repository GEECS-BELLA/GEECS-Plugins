"""Tool-name constants — the one place tool names are spelled.

The osprey ``bluesky_tool_names.py`` pattern: profile permission lists and
hook matchers import these symbols instead of retyping strings, so a
rename cannot silently strand a permission entry.

Safety classes (the planning doc's vocabulary): every v0 tool is **R**
(read-only, auto-allow).  The v1 queueing/stop verbs will be added here
with their classes when they land.
