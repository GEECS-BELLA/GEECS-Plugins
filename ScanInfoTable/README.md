# ScanInfoTable
This code runs a GUI that shows a table of scan infomation and parameters of the day. This is a simpler version of [ScanInfoToGsheet](https://github.com/GEECS-BELLA/GEECS-Plugins/tree/master/ScanInfoToGsheet), since this code just shows a table (not saving). It is sufull when you want to look back several run days quickly.

## How to run
Commandline: `python ScanInfoTable.py`, or right click the file and choose **open with python**.

## Features
* Each row has a button on the left that will clipboard the scan infromation as a text.
* Click 'Update' to update the table.

## Notes
*Since this code uses an outdated module Tix, it is not straightforward to compile to .exe file.
