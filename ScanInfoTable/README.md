#ScanInfoTable
This code runs an interface that shows a list of scan infomation of the day.
Simply run this script by  clicking the file and choose 'open with python'.
Or open a cygwin or terminal then type "python ScanInfoTable.py".
Each row has a button on the left that will clipboard the scan infromation as a text.
Click 'Update' to update the table.

*Since this code uses an outdated module Tix, it is not straightforward to compile to .exe file.
