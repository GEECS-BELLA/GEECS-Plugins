# Changelog — geecs-python-api

All notable changes to this package will be documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-08

### Removed
- `api_defs.py`: dropped deprecated `ScanTag` backward-compat stub and its
  unconditional module-level `warnings.warn()` (fired on every import). No
  external callers found — `ScanTag` now lives exclusively in `geecs_data_utils`.
- `api_defs.py`: removed dead `exec_async()` helper and unused `dateutil` import.
- `controls/__init__.py`: removed `__getattr__` shim that re-exported `ScanTag`;
  no callers found across the monorepo.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- `GeecsDevice._execute()`: when `is_valid()` is False (device not connected),
  now raises `GeecsDeviceInstantiationError` instead of silently returning
  `None`. Callers (`set()`, `get()`) could previously receive `None` and pass
  it through, masking the disconnected-device error.
- `UdpServer.__init__()`: added `SO_REUSEADDR` before `bind()`. On macOS and
  Windows, rapid open/close cycles between scans caused `OSError: [Errno 48]
  Address already in use` (Windows: WinError 10048) because the previous
  socket's port hadn't been released yet.

### Added
- Hardware integration test suite in
  `tests/geecs_python_api/controls/test_geecs_device_hardware.py`.
  Targets `U_S1H` (power supply). Run with `poetry run pytest --hardware`.
  Includes regression tests that reproduced both bugs before the fixes.
- `tests/conftest.py`: `--hardware` CLI flag and `geecs_exp_info` session
  fixture for database-backed hardware tests.
- `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml` with `hardware` marker and
  `testpaths = ["tests"]`.

### Changed
- `pyproject.toml`: removed stale `{include = "labview_interface"}` package
  entry (module was deleted in 0.4.0).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-08

### Removed
- `htu_scripts/` — HTU-specific utility scripts (not part of the library API)
- `labview_interface/` — LabVIEW TCP/UDP bridge (unused, no known callers)
- `geecs_python_api/analysis/` — scan analysis utilities (superseded by
  `ScanAnalysis` package)
- `geecs_python_api/tools/` — distributions, file utilities, and interface
  helpers (timestamping functions migrated to `geecs_data_utils.utils`)
- `geecs_python_api/controls/experiment/` — `Experiment` wrapper class
  (unused outside HTU-specific scripts)
- `geecs_python_api/controls/devices/HTU/` — HTU device subclasses
  (experiment-specific, not a library concern)

### Changed
- `PW_scripts/` relocated to `extras/PW_scripts/` (not a library concern;
  preserved in `extras/` for ad-hoc reference)

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- `dequeue_command()` now catches `GeecsDeviceCommandRejected` (logged as
  warning) and bare `Exception` (logged as error) so rejected commands never
  produce unhandled "Exception in thread" output in daemon threads
- `_process_command()` guards against `dev_udp is None` (device already closed)
  with an early return instead of a bare `assert`, eliminating `AssertionError`
  tracebacks when dequeue threads outlive `device.close()`
