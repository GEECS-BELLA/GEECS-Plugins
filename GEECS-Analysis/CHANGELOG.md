# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Beam, line and preprocessing-only measures, numpy-free scalar discovery and
  write-free `analyze(Frame, Analysis)` execution.
- Typed measurements with owned scalar maps, projections, centroid overlays
  and explicit notes for nonfinite results.
- Existing line/beam/slopes algorithms ported with scalar conventions retained;
  beam x/y coordinates come from Frame axes and RMS mutates only private scratch.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Pure, ordered and repeatable processing pipelines over coordinate-aware Frames.
- Numpy-free Pydantic specs and a builtin step registry.
- Constant background, coordinate/index ROI, median, Gaussian, clipping and
  zero-below steps with legacy numerical comparisons.
