"""GatewaySetpointPut — the one blessed gateway ``:SP`` put primitive.

Three call sites used to implement "write a value to a gateway ``:SP`` with
GEECS-completion semantics" independently: :class:`~geecs_bluesky.devices.ca.
settable.CaSettable`/``CaMotor``'s Layer-1 ophyd signal put, ``ShotController``'s
``CaPutSetter`` raw caput, and the action factory's wire settable raw caput.
Each pathway independently decided the PV **addressing dialect** — ophyd's
``ca://`` signal URI vs the bare EPICS name aioca expects — and one got it
wrong: a raw caput to a ``ca://…`` name CA-searches for a PV nothing serves
and hangs for the full timeout (issue #490, the 2026-07-10 closeout hang).
This module is the consolidation: one primitive owns the addressing rule,
the wire-value conventions, the timeout policy, the ``AsyncStatus`` wrapping,
and mock support; every consumer delegates.  (The legacy engine learned the
same lesson as ``DeviceCommandExecutor`` — its single blessed command path.)

Two transports, one policy owner:

- **raw CA** (``setpoint_pv=…``) — ``aioca.caput(bare_name, wire, wait=True,
  timeout=…)``.  Names are normalized by :func:`bare_pv`: the ophyd ``ca://``
  scheme is stripped (aioca treats a scheme as part of the PV name), any other
  scheme is rejected.  The gateway forwards ``:SP`` puts to GEECS's blocking
  UDP set and only completes the CA put when GEECS accepts (or rejects) it —
  so put-completion *is* the legacy ``wait_for_execution`` semantics.
- **ophyd signal** (``signal=…``) — delegates to ``signal.set(...)`` on a
  typed ``epics_signal_rw`` built from the ``ca://`` URI form (ophyd parses
  the scheme itself; see :mod:`geecs_bluesky.devices.ca._pv`).  Used by
  ``CaSettable``/``CaMotor`` Layer 1, whose typed signal doubles as the
  connect-time dtype check and the mock-backend seam
  (``tests/ca_mock_helpers.follow_setpoint``).

Wire-value conventions (the ``coerce`` parameter — each consumer's pinned,
hardware-proven convention; do not "unify" them without live verification):

- ``str`` — everything stringified: the ShotController convention (enum
  labels pass through; the gateway's typed channel coerces numeric strings).
- :func:`wire_value` — native numerics, wire string otherwise: the
  action-plan convention (a *string* put-with-callback to a float gateway
  channel can hang; observed live 2026-07-10, issue #490).
- ``None`` — pass through untouched: the typed-signal (motor) convention.

    coerce : callable, optional
        ``value → wire value``, applied once per put; ``None`` passes the
        value through untouched.  See the module docstring for the pinned

    timeout : float, optional

        defers to the signal's own default.
    name : str
        Movable name (Bluesky logging / message repr).
    mock : bool
        Raw transport only: record puts on ``last_mock_put`` (as the string
        form of the wire value) instead of touching CA.
